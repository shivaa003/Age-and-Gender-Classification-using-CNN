# Age-and-Gender-Classification-using-CNN

Age and Gender Classification using CNN and OpenCV

This project harnesses the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and OpenCV to accurately classify faces into age groups (such as child, youth, adult) and genders (male, female) by analyzing facial features from images or video streams. Utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the model delivers precise and reliable predictions.

By combining the capabilities of CNNs and OpenCV, this project offers a robust and efficient solution for accurately determining age and gender, providing valuable insights and enhancing various applications across different fields.
